== Documentation

=== Where should I start?

This README is the only bit of documentation right now.

Please see https://github.com/norton/lets for an Erlang application
that has been developed and tested by using *only* QC.

=== What is QuickCheck?

QuickCheck is a commercial property-based testing tool for Erlang.

- A _language_ for stating properties of programs (implemented as a
  library of functions and macros).
- A _tool_ for testing properties in randomly generated cases.

See http://www.quviq.com/ for further details.

=== What is Proper?

PropEr (PROPerty-based testing tool for ERlang) is a
QuickCheck-inspired open-source property-based testing tool for
Erlang.

See http://proper.softlab.ntua.gr/ for further details.
